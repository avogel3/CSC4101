------Notes-----
As of 11/15/2015, only 1 test is passing. Which is the first one. 
The second one is generating output but it appears that it is onlt pretty 
printing and not actually stepping through the functions. We believe it might
be related to a mistak in implementation of eval our call to find. The third 
test does not generate output at all. Perhaps a mistake in eval. We are going
to work on it a bit monday to see if we can debug a bit further.

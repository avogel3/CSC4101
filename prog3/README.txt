Project 3 -> Scheme Interpreter Extension
Due: 12/05/2015

========NOTES=======
From what I can tell, everything seems to be working. The for-each function behaved weird for me
when I tested it, but I was unable to throw much at it because I got close to the deadline.
I removed the built-ins from my project as instructed by the rubric. However, I can submit them
if needed.
